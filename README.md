# OpenAI-API-Caller-Files
Given the paths of a few files and some input text, returns a response from OpenAI given those files and input text.

# Important notes:
This currently only supports text-based file types. This should suffice for most coding and writing needs, but if you want images to be taken, that's gonna come later probable.

Image support: LATER\
